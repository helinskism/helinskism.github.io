### About this Site
I generated this portfolio website using [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/), a documentation site generator. The tool parses Markdown files and displays them as a website. I customized the look of the site using a code editor and uploaded to Github pages for hosting.

I created the Trello and Docuscope work samples using the OxygenXML Help Authoring Tool. In a Software Documentation course at Carnegie Mellon, we were assigned to choose two programs to document using DITA.
